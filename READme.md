This project is a number guessing game that utilizes media queries for responsive design, as well as positioning using `flex-box` without `grid`

## Description
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application window responds to resizing down to 320px for mobile viewports. 
Semantic tags were strategically placed in our HTML, which included the implementation of the `<output>` and `<template>` 
elements. Most JavaScript functions are under 10 lines long.
